## 🚩 What are we trying to solve?

Local businesses often rely on outdated or manual systems to manage their operations. These systems are prone to human error, lack integration, and offer minimal insights into business performance. As a result, many businesses face challenges such as:

- Inefficient sales tracking  
- Poor inventory management  
- Limited customer insight  
- No real-time analytics  

**NeoPOS** solves these problems with a clean interface, real-time reporting, and features designed to simplify retail management.
